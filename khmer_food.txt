Bai domram is a rice dish served with multiple side dishes meant to be eaten with it. It is prepared by allowing the cooked rice to cool overnight and absorb the morning dew. This process infuses the rice with a subtle essence. To enhance the aroma, jasmine flowers are added to the dish in the morning. During the dry season, bai domram is appreciated for its cooling effect.

Amok is a popular Cambodian dish that is typically made with fish. The fish is marinated in a mixture of spices and coconut milk, then steamed in banana leaves.

No matter what type of amok you try, it is sure to be a delicious experience.
